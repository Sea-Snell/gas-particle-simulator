# gas-particle-simulator
simulates the motion of an ideal gas

vary the volume in m^2 and the temperature in kelvin

see the average kenitic energy in Joules and the preasure in nano pascals

Works best only simulating about 100-150 particles at once, any more will probably result in lag. The particle collision algorithm is O(n^2), so just keep that in mind.
